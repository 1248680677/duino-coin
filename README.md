There are many cryptocurrencies available. However, there are none that use avr boards. I think it's a great idea to use them.

Here's why:
* You may have some Arduino boards that don't do anything. Why not help duino-coin network by mining?
* In the future, duino-coin may be worth something. So why not mine some?
* Even if duino-coin won't ever catch any value, you will be able to proudly say that you supported beginner programmer project :smile:

### Built With
This section briefly lists major frameworks that you duino-coin uses.
* [Python and IDLE](https://www.python.org)
* [pySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc)
* [serveo](https://serveo.net)
