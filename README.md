  A first-ever cryptocurrency that can be profitably mined with regular home computers, smartphones, Arduino boards and everything that can hash SHA. <br>

**Duino-Coin is:**
* **centralized** - no need to download gigabytes of stuff, your funds are secure
* **available worldwide** - all you need is internet access
* **cost effective** - why? read [this blog post](https://revoxhere.github.io/duino-coin/blog#1102019-why-its-the-best-time-to-mine-duino-coins)
* **open-source** - anyone can contribute

## Prerequisites

### Linux
If you're using Linux, you need to download some dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python-pip
python3 -m pip install pyserial
```
### Windows
If you're just a casual user and don't care about unstable stuff you don't need to install anything. Just grab latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases) and you're ready to go.

***

If you want to run Arduino Miner after cloning it from GitHub repo instead of downloading release, make sure you have `pyserial` library installed (`py -m pip install pyserial`).
