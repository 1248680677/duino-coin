There are many cryptocurrencies available. However, there are none that use avr boards. I think it's a great idea to use them.

Here's why:
* You may have some Arduino boards that don't do anything.
* In the future, duino-coin may be worth something.
* Even if duino-coin won't ever catch any value, you will be able to proudly say that you supported beginner programmer project :smile:

## News
