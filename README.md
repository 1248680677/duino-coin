There are many cryptocurrencies available. Most of them can be mined, but only using powerful CPUs, GPUs or ASICs to make some real money. There aren't many that support "normal" ways of mining. <br>
I've always wanted to do something related to cryptocurrencies with Arduino. Thats why I created Duino-Coin. Cryptocurrency that can be mined with regular home computers, smartphones (you can use app called [PyDroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3) to run PC Miner), Arduino boards (you can find Arduino code in every [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases)) and much more in the future.

Generally, why should you mine Duino-Coin?
* ~In the future, duino-coin may be worth something.~ 1 DUCO (Duino-Coin) is worth ~0.1 XMG (Coin Magi) at the time I'm writing this. You can exchange it [here](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/).
* Mining Duino-Coins isn't very CPU intensive.
* It can be mined using various platforms.
* Mining on regular computers and smartphones is profitable.
* You will be able to proudly say that you supported my project :smile:

Why would you want to mine on Arduino?
* You may have some Arduino boards that don't do anything.
* Watching Arduino do something useful that produces money is satisfying.

## Prerequisites

### Linux
If you're using Linux, you need to download some dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python-pip
python -m pip install pyserial
```
### Windows
If you're just a casual user and don't care about unstable stuff you don't need to install anything. Just grab latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases) and you're ready to go.

## Getting Started

Grab latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases) for your OS. <br>
Launch `Wallet` to register. Then you can login. <br>
After making an account, run `Miner` or `Arduino Miner` to mine Duino-Coins. <br>
Programs will display you all information and help you need. <br>

If you need detailed help about usage, installation or configuration, see our [Wikis](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/wiki). <br>
If you can't find what you need, open an [Issue](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/issues), we'll help in no time!
