There are many cryptocurrencies available. However, there are none that use avr boards. I think it's a great idea to use them.

Here's why:
* You may have some Arduino boards that don't do anything. Why not help duino-coin network by mining?
* In the future, duino-coin may be worth something. So why not mine some?
* Even if duino-coin won't ever catch any value, you will be able to proudly say that you supported beginner programmer project :smile:

### Built With
This section briefly lists major frameworks that you duino-coin uses.
* [Python and IDLE](https://www.python.org)
* [pySerial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/)
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc)
* [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Instructions to get started with duino-coins.

### Prerequisites

#### Windows
If you're using Windows, just grab latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases) for Windows.
Unzip the archive and you are ready to go.

#### Linux
If you're using Linux, you need to download some dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt install python3 python-pip
python -m pip install pyserial
```
Then download latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases) for Linux and unzip it.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

#### Windows
After you have downloaded latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases), just launch `Miner.exe` or `Wallet.exe`
depending on what you want to do.

#### Linux
After you have downloaded prerequisites and latest [release](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases), launch `Miner.py` or `Wallet.py` using `python3`
depending on what you want to do.

**NOTE: if connecting to arduino fails, you may need to use `sudo` to lauch `Miner.py`!**
```bash
sudo python3 Miner.py
```
