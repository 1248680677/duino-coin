# Duino-Coin miner for STM32 chips family

- Use platform.io to open/build
- Edit platformio.ini file to setup your upload method
    - I'm uploading my via serial connected to A9/A10 pins
- Use AVR_Miner as with any other Arduino board
- Tested on:
    - Bluepill (STM32F103C8) board (~6000 H/s)

Happy mining!:)
