## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Where can I exchange Duino-Coins to some other cryptocurrencies?** <br>
**A: E.g. at [DUCO Exchange](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/).**

**Q: Why sometimes mining stops, I can't check account balance and when I try to reconnect it doesn't work?** <br>
**A: Lately our TCP tunnel provider is probably having some connection issues. We can't do much about it.** Just wait some time (usually 1-3 hours) and everything should work fine. If problem persists for a longer time, open an [Issue](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/issues) or check [Duino-Coin Blog](https://revoxhere.github.io/duino-coin/) for news.

More to come in the future.
