Server has received a few bugfixes and optimalization changes (thanks, MrKris7100!) <br>
PC Miner (AutoIT and Python) - also done. <br>
GUI Wallet - 1/3 done. <br>
Arduino code - I haven't started working at it yet. <br>

## 19.08.2019: SHA1 Server and miner done!!!
SHA1 Algorithm is now fully working and implemented.<br>
**Everything thanks to MrKris7100!** <br>
Things left to do: Wallet, some Miner changes and Arduino code. <br>
Servers will be back online in a few days, as soon as everything's ready. <br>

## 18.08.2019: Planned (temporary) server inaccessibility
Due to many changes, official servers will be offline for a few days.<br>
We need to fix and change many things so this may take some time. <br>
When we'll be done, you will be notified by a new release, blog post and readme file changes. <br>

Welcome back! <br>
Sorry for inactivity, I was on a little vacation. <br>
**Proper SHA1 algorithm is almost done** (see previous post). <br>
Official servers were offline for I think ~2 days, sorry for that. Now they're up and running. <br>

## 12.08.2019: New reward system
Hi duino miners! <br>
Today a new release is out! <br>
Featuring new reward system. **Here's how it works:** <br>
Miner sends his current work to the server. <br>
Server hashes the result and compares it with result submitted by miner. <br>
If they're equal, a new, higher, standard payout is added to the account. <br>
If result's aren't the same or miner hasn't submitted his work, very low or zero payout is made (invalid share). <br>
This way, I kept (partial) compatibilty with older miners and softly pushed new algorithm. <br>
<br>
Also, server update: now shares cannot be submitted faster than 150ms (each). This prevents attacks and invalid share spam. <br>
**That's it for today! Happy mining!**
