## 2.09.2019: Exchange Duino-Coins to Coin Magi
I'm proudly to announce, that you can now experimentally exchange DUCO to XMG! <br>
**DUCO Exchange service:** [https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/](https://revoxhere.github.io/duco-exchange/) <br>

## 30.08.2019: Pool/servers are back online

***

## 29.08.2019: Scheduled pool inaccessibility
Official servers will be offline for a few days as I'm changing some things in software. <br>
Sorry for this! <br>

## 25.08.2019: Alpha 5.1 - Small update
In today's new release I've fixed a bug between Miner and Wallet. <br>
It doesn't break compatibility with older version, so if everything's working fine for you, **you can stay on Alpha 5.** <br>

## 25.08.2019: Plans for next release
Hello! In this blog post I'm going to present some future features (probably for next release?). <br>
Firstly, I'll make a few YouTube videos to spread the word about DUCO. <br>
GUI Wallet will be receive a bit better UI, mainly some tweaks in existing design. <br>
When I'll get my hands on ESP8266 or NodeMCU Wifi boards, I'll think about ability for them to mine without need of a computer. <br>
In plans I also have making a GUI Miner (but much later, it's not very needed). <br>
That's it for today. Cheers!

## 22.08.2019: ALPHA 5 IS OUT!!!
**SHA1 IMPLEMENTATION, GUI WALLET, NEW MINER, NEW ARDUINO MINER - ALL OF THIS IN [NEW RELEASE](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases)!** <br>
Many new, exciting, fresh stuff today! Everything I spoke about in previous posts is now ready to use! <br>
What are you waiting for? Download all-new Arduino Miner and start mining those Duino-Coins! :smile:

## 20.08.2019: Quick info
Server has received a few bugfixes and optimalization changes (thanks, MrKris7100!) <br>
PC Miner (AutoIT and Python) - also done. <br>
GUI Wallet - 1/3 done. <br>
Arduino code - I haven't started working at it yet. <br>

## 19.08.2019: SHA1 Server and miner done!!!
SHA1 Algorithm is now fully working and implemented.<br>
**Everything thanks to MrKris7100!** <br>
Things left to do: Wallet, some Miner changes and Arduino code. <br>
Servers will be back online in a few days, as soon as everything's ready. <br>

## 18.08.2019: Planned (temporary) server inaccessibility
Due to many changes, official servers will be offline for a few days.<br>
We need to fix and change many things so this may take some time. <br>
When we'll be done, you will be notified by a new release, blog post and readme file changes. <br>

## 17.08.2019: Quick status update
Welcome back! <br>
Sorry for inactivity, I was on a little vacation. <br>
**Proper SHA1 algorithm is almost done** (see previous post). <br>
Official servers were offline for I think ~2 days, sorry for that. Now they're up and running. <br>

## 14.08.2019: Better algorithm in the works
Hi everyone! <br>
Thanks to MrKris7100 SHA1 implementation is now worked on! <br>
Big beer for him! See ya'll later in the next update. <br>

## 12.08.2019: New reward system
Hi duino miners! <br>
Today a new release is out! <br>
Featuring new reward system. **Here's how it works:** <br>
Miner sends his current work to the server. <br>
Server hashes the result and compares it with result submitted by miner. <br>
If they're equal, a new, higher, standard payout is added to the account. <br>
If result's aren't the same or miner hasn't submitted his work, very low or zero payout is made (invalid share). <br>
This way, I kept (partial) compatibilty with older miners and softly pushed new algorithm. <br>
<br>
Also, server update: now shares cannot be submitted faster than 150ms (each). This prevents attacks and invalid share spam. <br>
**That's it for today! Happy mining!**
