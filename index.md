## 12.08.2019: New reward system
Hi duino miners! <br>
Today a new release is out! <br>
Featuring new reward system. **Here's how it works:** <br>
Miner sends his current work to the server. <br>
Server hashes the result and compares it with result submitted by miner. <br>
If they're equal, a new, higher, standard payout is added to the account. <br>
If result's aren't the same or miner hasn't submitted his work, very low or zero payout is made (invalid share). <br>
This way, I kept (partial) compatibilty with older miners and softly pushed new algorithm. <br>
<br>
Also, server update: now shares cannot be submitted faster than 150ms (each). This prevents attacks and invalid share spam. <br>
**That's it for today! Happy mining!**
